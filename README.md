EECE 430: Software Engineering.

The Sports Club Management System (SCMS) is a web-app that resembles a general club's website. This project is a template to how such an app would be implemented.
It will be a client-server based system, that uses HTML, CSS, and JS for frontend, Python Django/Flask for backend, and MySQL for data storage.

It has multiple features (from logging in to buying merchandise and tickets).

The collaborators in this project are:
Mira Awar
Adam Hazimeh
Ali Hijjawi
