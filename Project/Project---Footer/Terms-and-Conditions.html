          <p>You may only view, print out and use the Website and the Materials for your own personal, non-commercial use. We expressly reserve all intellectual property rights in and to the Website and the Materials and your use of the Website and Materials is subject to the following restrictions. You must not (a) remove any copyright or other proprietary notices contained in the Materials; (b) save where expressly permitted by us to do so, modify the Materials in any way or reproduce them (c) publicly display, perform, or distribute or otherwise use the Materials for any public or commercial purpose; (c) transfer the Materials to any other person; (d) use any Materials from the Website in any manner that may infringe any intellectual property right, proprietary right, or property right of us or any third parties; or (e) reproduce, modify, display, perform, publish, distribute, disseminate, broadcast, frame, communicate to the public or circulate to any third party or exploit this Website and/or the Materials in any way; without our prior written consent. Where we permit you to modify any of the Materials, we shall own all rights in the modified Material and you hereby assign to us all copyright and all other rights of whatever nature, whether now known or created in the future, in the modified Material for the whole term of the same including any renewals, reversions, revivals and extensions together with all related rights and powers. You warrant that any modified Materials created by you shall be your original work and shall not infringe any laws or regulations or the rights of any person and shall not be obscene, threatening, abusive, harmful to others, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, harassing, discriminatory or otherwise objectionable.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">UNACCEPTABLE CONTENT</span>
          </p>
          <p>If you find any content on our Website to be in any way offensive, obscene, defamatory, racist, harmful, inaccurate, unlawful, illegal, infringing of any third party rights, deceptive in any way or otherwise in breach of our content standards, please notify us by clicking here and using the subject heading “Unacceptable content”.</p>

          <p>We realise and understand that many children will visit our Website but we encourage all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any content or information to this Website and indeed any other web site. We believe that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner’s personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.</p>
